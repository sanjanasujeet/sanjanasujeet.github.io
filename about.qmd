My name is Sanjana and I am currently an third year undergrad at UCSB studying Environmental Science and Spatial Science! I am interested in climate change science especially in the marine sphere as well as data science/visualization. I am passionate about bridging the gap between the science community and the public through data visualization, mapping, creative outlets, and removing the barriers of high scientific literacy needed to understand dense material. 

I am originally from Utah and I love traveling, hiking, tidepooling, sunset plunges, finding cute coffee shops and antique stores, any form of art but especially oil and charcoal, and I just started scuba diving!
