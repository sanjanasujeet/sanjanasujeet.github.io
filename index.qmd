Hi welcome to my entire life fit into a tiny corner of the internet! Feel free to explore my research and experience, arts and hobbies, as well as my travel and milestone trackers.

## About

My name is Sanjana and I am an undergrad at UCSB studying Environmental Science! I am also interested in Data Science and Climate Change Science especially in the marine sphere. I am originally from Utah, love hiking, art, and classical Indian dance called Bharatanatyam.
