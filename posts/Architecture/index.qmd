For my ENVS 40 Critical Thinking and Reasoning in Environmental Studies, I wrote a research paper where I conducted literature reviews on architecture styles across culture. I wanted to combine my interests of anthropology and sustainability. This essay goes over modern high-energy construction issues, different ancient buildings from various civilizations that addressed the same issues while using less energy, and suggestions on how to integrate them together.

It won 1st place in the Library Award for Undergraduate Research in the Social Science category and was published in the Open Access Publications from the University of California- eScholarship! [here is a link to the published article](https://escholarship.org/uc/item/1198n2k9)
